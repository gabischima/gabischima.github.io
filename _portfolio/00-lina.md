  title: Lina Design System - Mobile iOS
  subtitle: '<b>Acted as:</b> iOS developer, designer and javascript developer.'
  description: Led the development of the iOS SPM library for our design system, making it themable, reusable, and versioned. Created scripts to generate custom swift files using Style-dictionary, and organized the components' tokens considering the particularities of the mobile environment. Also construct the architecture for the Styles, a class received by the component translating the tokens, making it reusable in both UIKit and SwiftUI.
