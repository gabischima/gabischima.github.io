      Enne is a blank character. Brings with it limit and freedom. Constant challenge to thin outside the box, beyond contour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tattooed to change it constantly, but I learned that I also don't have to. It's complete within it self, though it accepts (wishes) interactions from me or others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What it can be, not what it must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all started with sharing to Instagram, later asking other to draw in it, and now I share it virtually, beyond me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ennething app was born to take this interaction to others. So they can mount their own Enne. Or  dismount even.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015 was the app's first release, with the Aumented Reality (AR) tecnology not so common and many paths to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020, with new technologies and possibilities, I rebuilt it with new interactions but keeping the premise: build your own Enne and share it online.
