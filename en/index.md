    <p>
      I have a B.A. degree in Digital Media Design, at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) and for my bachelor's final project, in 2013, I designed and developed an Augmented Reality demo app for temporary tattoos called TattooAR. It was later presented at the Human-Computer Interaction International Conference 2015, in Los Angeles - CA.

    <p>
      That project inspired me to study programming and in 2015 I took part of the Apple Developer Academy. The program is a partnership between Apple and PUC-Rio to form iOS developers, teaching Swift and Objective-C, among other skills such as mobile design and entrepreneurship. With the knowledge I gained in the program, I was selected for the Scholarship tickets to attend to WWDC 2015 and 2016.

      At WWDC I first experienced the gender inequality in STEM disciplines. In March 2016, along with other women from Apple Academy, we started the Tutoras project - a pro-bono project to empower women through programming - that ended in 2017.

      In July 2016, I started my own company along with 3 associates, developing websites and apps. I was responsible for designing and developing front and backend (PHP/Ruby on Rails) applications, websites (Wordpress), native and hybrid apps (Swift/Angular/Angularjs). I also handled client meetings and project management.
    </p>
    <p>
      In December 2017, I left my company to work as Front-end developer in a multidisciplinary team at Stone Payments, also giving support for design and iOS development. After the project’s termination, I was transferred to Mundipagg - a Stone.co company - where I work not only implementing Webapps (Vue/Angular), but also identifying opportunities and needs of the company’s Design System.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of my current job as Front-end, I’m always searching for opportunities in the mobile iOS field. In December 2018 I freelanced for a month at Zee.dog, to speed up the Zee.now app's delivery within a short deadline. I’m also developing personal apps, studying SwiftUI and ARKit. I have a project at the App Store called ennecoisa app: an Augmented Reality app for my personal tattoo and business card.
