      Designer from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), started working with graphic design in 2012 at Studio Pira, where I also had drawing lessons. I left in August 2012 to start a 1 year academic research scholarship at PUC-Rio.

      Throughout 2013 I designed my bachelor's final project TattooAR: an augmented reality app for temporary tattoos, later presented at the Human-Computer Interaction International Conference 2015, in Los Angeles - CA.

      In 2015 I took part of the Apple Academy. The internship is an association between Apple and PUC-Rio to teach Swift and Objective-C for iOS development, among other skills such as mobile design and entrepreneurship. With the knowledge gained in the program, I won the Scholarship tickets for WWDC 2015 and 2016.

      I first experienced the gender inequality in STEM disciplines at WWDC 2015. In March 2016, along with other women from Apple Academy, the Tutoras project started - a pro-bono project to empower women through programming - and ended in 2017, due to lack of free time from the administrators.

      Also in 2016, I illustrated for Revista Pólen, and, in July, started my own company along with 3 associates, developing websites and hybrid apps in ionic. In December 2017, I left to work as Front-end developer at Stone Payments. After 6 months I transferred to Mundipagg - a Stone company - to work not only as Front-ender but also Designer.
